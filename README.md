# Sudoku
This project consists of three **Java** files:

    - Menu.java
    - Move.java
    - Sudoku.java
    
Menu.java builds the user interface for the project and contains various tabs and options that users can use to obtain hints, check their work, and see the full solution for the Sudoku.

Move.java sets up the matrix for the game and is responsible for checking if the row index and column index are valid.

Sudoku.java deals with ActionListener tasks and contains the actual methods for drawing and changing the game board.
